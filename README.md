# Machine Learning Project: Clothing Type Classification

## Overview
This project is part of the Machine Learning course for the BSc program in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen, guided by Therese Graversen. Our focus is on developing various methods, including custom implementations and established algorithms, to determine the type of clothing from images in the Fashion MNIST dataset. This repository contains the project report and the Python source code.

## Team Members
- Bogdan Mihaila
- Alexis Serruys

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 15,000 labeled images of clothing sourced from the Zalando website. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 picture, categorized into one of five types: T-shirt/top, trousers, pullover, dress, or shirt.

## Objectives
- Implement and evaluate a custom Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification.
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Develop and test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Implement a custom Naive Bayes classifier.
- Utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the dataset characteristics.

## Repository Structure
- `OurLDA.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code for our analysis and implementations.
- `report.pdf`: Detailed project report, including methodology, results, and discussion.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used in our analysis (not included in this repository due to size constraints).

## Implementation Details
We have explored the following approaches in this project:
- **Custom Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Implemented from scratch for classification.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied for dimensionality reduction.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Developed for advanced image classification tasks.
- **Custom Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implemented from scratch using NumPy and SciPy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilized for robust classification.

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open `OurLDA.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Results and Discussion
For detailed results and discussion, refer to `report.pdf`. This document contains comprehensive insights into our methodology, findings, and the comparative analysis of different machine learning models.
